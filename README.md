# Sampling from a(n approximate) normalised power prior with Stan.

Package implementing the routines described in [Carvalho & Ibrahim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14912).

Depends on **rstan** and **bridgesampling** (see [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/maxbiostat/npowerPrioR/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) for more details).

Install the package with 

```r
remotes::install_github("maxbiostat/npowerPrioR")
```

A step-by-step tutorial can be found in [this](https://github.com/maxbiostat/npowerPrioR/blob/main/vignettes/Bernoulli.Rmd) vignette.

Any doubts, shoot me a message at `lmax` d.o.t `fgv` at gmail.

Many thanks to Chris Koenig and [Ben Jones](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/ben-jones) for testing early version of the code.
