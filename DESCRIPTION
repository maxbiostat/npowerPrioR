Depends: R (>= 4.0.0), parallel, mgcv, rstan, bridgesampling
Description: This package implements a bisection-type algorithm which employs bridge sampling to obtain marginal likelihood estimates and then fit an "emulation" function to approximate the normalising constant `c(a0)`, predict it on a fine grid and then plug the resulting dictionary into a modified Stan program that will sample from the approximate posterior.
